# Example commands for running the scripts in this repo.
#
# Copyright (C) 2018  J. Michael Dyck <jmdyck@ibiblio.org>


# (Although this file may look like a shell script,
# you shouldn't treat it as such.)

# The scripts in $EK communicate via a pickle-file ($D/spec.pickle).
# To ensure that spec.pickle has the required info,
# there are some constraints on the order in which
# you run the scripts. 
# In this chart, each script is a 'child' of the script that it must follow:
#
#    analyze_spec.py
#     |- render_spec.py
#     |- operation_headers.py
#         |- static_type_analysis.py

# (Actually, the circumstances for running static_type_analysis.py
# are more complicated, but I'll get to that.)

# You might wonder why there are multiple scripts.
# If I had a faster computer or a faster implementation,
# the various scripts would instead be modules of a single executable,
# which would simply recalculate things from scratch
# each time it was invoked, for whatever purpose.
# But as things stand, that would take too long.
# In particular, parse_pseudocode.py and static_type_analysis.py
# take a while to run, so if I'm iterating on the latter,
# I don't want to wait for the former each time.

# ----

# These commands assume you're running from the main directory
# of the 'ecma262' repo (or a fork thereof).
# I.e., 'spec.html' is a file in the current directory.

# The location of the ecmaspeak-py directory:
EK=../ecmaspeak-py

# The scripts create a fair number of output files.
# To prevent them cluttering up the current directory,
# you specify (as the first arg to each script)
# another directory where they should all go.
# In the following commands, I use the shell variable $D for this.
# Specifically, `gcbn` returns git's current branch name,
alias gcbn='git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD'
# so D=_`gcbn` makes a separate directory for each branch.
# (The initial underscore makes the directories easy to gitignore.)

# Because of the large amount of output,
# it isn't practical to examine it all after each run.
# So instead, I typically only look at the differences
# between successive runs.
# The scripts generate their output as foo.new,
# then the 'car' command shows the difference (if any) between foo and foo.new,
# and prompts me to accept the new file.
# (car is a symlink or alias of the compare_and_replace.py script:
# https://github.com/jmdyck/compare_and_replace.py)
